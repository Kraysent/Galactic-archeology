# Model:
## Nearest future:
- Add heavy particle in the center.

## More distant future: 
- Play with mass resolution of the models.
- Play with direction and distance of the infall of the satellite

# Program: 
## Nearest future:
- Plot velocities in the reference frame of the disc.
- Add integration to the primary program.
- Implement pyfalcon integration to the integrator module of the program.
- Create kind of time plot that has no options.
- Draw visualizer plots with add_axes function and not with GridSpecs
- Draw velocity profile graph
- Draw distance of CMs over time

## More distant future:
- Add some kind of free parameters' space to the Snapshot class. Probably it should be made with PhaseSpace class that stores x, y, z, vx, vy, vz and some other parameters.
