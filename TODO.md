# Model:
## Nearest future:
- Add heavy particle in the center.

## More distant future: 
- Play with mass resolution of the models.
- Play with direction and distance of the infall of the satellite

# Program: 
## Nearest future:
- Plot velocities in the reference frame of the disc.
- Move slicing out of tasks to task manager
- Add integration to the primary program.
- Implement pyfalcon integration to the integrator module of the program.
- Create kind of time plot abstract class that has no options.
- Draw velocity profile graph
- Zoom the central region on the latter stages of evolution


## More distant future:
- Add some kind of free parameters' space to the Snapshot class. Probably it should be made with PhaseSpace class that stores x, y, z, vx, vy, vz and some other parameters.
