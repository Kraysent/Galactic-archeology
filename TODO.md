## Nearest future:
- Add integration to the primary program (using pyfalcon library in case or just console)
- Move density and contour plots to abstract class
- Create kind of time plot that has no options
- Move PlotParameters from task manager (they are not really connected)

## More distant future:
- Add some kind of free parameters' space to the Snapshot class. Probably it should be made with PhaseSpace class that stores x, y, z, vx, vy, vz and some other parameters
