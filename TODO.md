## Nearest future:
- Add integration to the primary program (using pyfalcon library in case or just console)

## More distant future:
- Add some kind of free parameters' space to the Snapshot class. Probably it should be made with PhaseSpace class that stores x, y, z, vx, vy, vz and some other parameters
