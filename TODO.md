# Model:
## Nearest future:
- Add heavy particle in the center.

## More distant future: 
- Play with mass resolution of the models.

# Program: 
## Nearest future:
- Plot velocities in the reference frame of the disc.
- Put Sun into the orbit on the plane of galaxy.
- Add integration to the primary program.
- Implement pyfalcon integration to the integrator module of the program.
- Create kind of time plot that has no options.
- Move PlotParameters from task manager (they are not really connected).

## More distant future:
- Add some kind of free parameters' space to the Snapshot class. Probably it should be made with PhaseSpace class that stores x, y, z, vx, vy, vz and some other parameters.
